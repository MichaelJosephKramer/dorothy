description: Announcement of going independent

I'll be staring life as an independent contractor on November 1st. Althought I've enjoyed my two years at my current employer, and learned a great deal, I'm excited about taking on some new challenges.~


In the future I hope to continue working as a developer and agile coach, working with technologies like JavaScript, Ruby, and .NET.

I've got my first client lined up, and I'll be working remotely and spending most of my time with JavaScript.
