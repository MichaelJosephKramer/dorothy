description: Tools used to build this blog with Ruby and Toto

Blogging has long been my mortal enemy. In fact, I've had more blog reboots than blog posts during my battle. This one is #4, and this time I'm determined to make it work. I swear.~


I wish I had a good excuse for not blogging more, but I won't bother to tell you my dog ate my homework. I do plan on writing about agile practices, Ruby, Node.js and JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and maybe a little .NET. This blog's reboot, in fact, was created with a Ruby blog engine called toto. 

Having rebooted my blog three times already, I did learn what I didn't like, and I had a small set of requirements:

- I wanted something simple -- not WordPress
- I wanted cheap (free?) hosting
- I wanted to be able to hack at it using languages I like
- I wanted to use tools I like, i.e., vim, git, etc.

Toto is a blog engine that bills itself as minimalistic, with a footprint of just 300 lines. It's designed to work with Heroku, and that's free. It's written in Ruby, and I like Ruby. And finally since the content is created in Markdown text files, a vim plugin is all I need to create the posts. Seems to meet the criteria.

Toto also has an accompanying template to work with it, called Dorothy. After a quick fork of it, I had it running quickly, was able to customize it easily, and found several helpful blog posts about it on the web. I also found some resources to help make it pretty.

Source Code:

- [Toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto "Toto")
- [Dorothy](https://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy "Dorothy")
- [My Fork of Dorothy](https://github.com/MichaelJosephKramer/dorothy "Dorothy")
- [Dodo](https://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy "Dodo") - Another fork of Dorothy. I used some of the ideas
